My goal: get a new profession, develop and expand in a new field. it is important for me now, because my current profession (design engineer) has become low paid, which will not allow me to fully realize all my dreams.
I'm starting to learn from scratch, and it's not easy. But I have a very great desire that moves me toward the goal. I strive for new knowledge. Interest and enthusiasm helps me take a lot of information without fatigue.
I graduated from the Belarusian National Technical University with a degree in civil engineering.  
My English level is not high. For the time being, in my opinion, my knowledge is enough to settle. But in the future I plan to study the language in depth.
